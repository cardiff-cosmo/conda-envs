# conda-envs
Useful conda envs for tricky packages. Here we provide some conda environment specification files which help you install various cosmology codes which can otherwise be a bit fiddly.

## Installing conda
Anaconda is now problematic (see e.g. [here](https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/08/anaconda_puts_the_squeeze_on/)) the preferred safe way of installing conda is through [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge).

## Using these envs
Install these envs with:
> `conda env create --file <example.yml>`
